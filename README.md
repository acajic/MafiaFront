Mafia client side
===============

After pulling the repo

1) Go to Mafia/app/serverService.js
and setup the url for the api server. The repository for Mafia server side can be found on https://github.com/acajic/Mafia


2) When changing any javascript code, you should merge all javascript code from Mafia/app directory into one .js file - Mafia/app/mafia.js). On Windows, executing the Mafia/app/minify.bat will do this for you.
