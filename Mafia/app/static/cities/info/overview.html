Games are listed as <i>cities</i>. Players of a game are residents of that city. <br/>

Most of the residents in a city are innocent people.
But there is a mysterious small group of people in each city that form <b>the Mafia</b>.
Nobody of <i>the innocents</i> knows who these people are, but they know each other among themselves.
<br/>

The essence of this game is a competition between two <b>teams</b> - <b>the Citizens</b> and <b>the Mafia</b>. </br>

The objective for <b>the Citizens</b> is to kill every Mafia member. </br>
The objective for <b>the Mafia</b> is to kill enough citizens so that mafia members become 50% of entire city's population or more. </br>

If either of these two objectives are completed, the game is over. </br>

After the game is started, a city repeatedly goes through <b>day and night phases</b>. </br>

The <b>killings</b> occur in one of the following ways:
<ul>
    <li>
        During each night, mafia members vote who they want to kill. The resident that gets the most votes, will be dead the next morning.
        In this secret internal voting, mafia members need to be harmonized:
        strictly more than half (>50%) of alive mafia members need to vote for the same resident in order for mafia hit to be successful.
    </li>
    <li>
        During each day, citizens organize a public voting - a lynch. The idea is to vote for a resident that is believed to be a part of the Mafia.
        A resident that gets the most votes is executed at the end of the day. (Votes don't have to be >50%) </br>
        Every living resident in town (including the Mafia members) has access to this public voting.
    </li>
</ul>

<br/>
<br/>

If you die during the game, that <b>does NOT</b> mean you lost the game.
The fact you died merely means that your votes and actions no longer count and they don't affect the state of the game.
As mentioned earlier, the game is a competition between <b>teams</b>. That means you either <b>lose as a team, or win as a team</b>. <br/>

<br/>

The only problem may be that, at first, you don't even know who else is on your team with you :).
