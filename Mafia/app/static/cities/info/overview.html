The friends you invite to the game are automatically and immediately registered and their credentials are delivered to them via email.
They are also immediately joined to the game you created. This means that you can:
<ol>
    <li>create the game,</li>
    <li>add your friends to the game by email,</li>
    <li>and start it up!</li>
</ol>
All within the next 10 minutes. Duration of a game varies based on your preference. The quickest games can be played out within couple of hours.
However, it is more common that <b>a single game lasts several days</b>.
Yes, that's right. So, prepare yourself, this is not the same Mafia you've played before.
Because the games usually last for a longer period of time, the players can log in and actually join the action <b>after the game is already in progress</b>.

<h2>Game Overview</h2>

Game participants are playing that they are residents of a single town. <br/>
Most of the residents in a town are innocent people.
But there is a mysterious small group of people in the town that form <b>the Mafia</b>.
Nobody of <i>the innocents</i> knows who these people are, but they know each other among themselves.
<br/>
<br/>
<i>The innocents</i> (also called <b>the Citizens</b>) need to find out which of the other players belong to the Mafia, before the Mafia kills them all.

The essence of this game is a competition between these two teams - <b>the Citizens</b> and <b>the Mafia</b>. </br>

The objective for <b>the Citizens</b> is to kill every Mafia member. </br>
The objective for <b>the Mafia</b> is to kill enough citizens so that mafia members become 50% of entire town's population or more. </br>

If either of these two objectives gets completed, the game is over. </br>

After the game is started, a town repeatedly goes through <b>day and night phases</b>. </br>

The <b>killings</b> occur primarily in one of the following ways:
<ul>
    <li>
        During each night, mafia members vote who they want to kill. The resident that gets the most votes, will be dead the next morning.
        In this secret internal voting, mafia members need to be harmonized.
        Strictly more than half (>50%) of alive mafia members need to vote for the same resident in order for a mafia hit to be successful.
    </li>
    <li>
        During each day, citizens organize a public voting - a lynch. The idea is to vote for a resident that is believed to be a part of the Mafia.
        A resident that gets the most votes is executed at the end of the day. (Votes don't have to be >50%) </br>
        Every living resident in town (including the Mafia members) has access to this public voting.
    </li>
</ul>

<br/>
<br/>

If you die during the game, that <b>does NOT</b> mean you are defeated or that you <i>lost the game</i>.
The fact you died merely means that your votes and actions no longer count and they don't affect the state of the game.
If you manage to stay alive until the end of the game, but your team was defeated, this means that you are defeated as well.
If, on the other hand, you die early in the game, but your teams ends up winning the game, this means that you are also victorious.
As mentioned earlier, the game is a competition between <b>teams</b>. That means you either <b>lose as a team, or win as a team</b>.

<br/>

<br/>

The only problem may be that, at first, you don't even know who else is on your team with you :).



<h2>Playing traditionally</h2>

Mafia is an old game that is played live, through personal interaction and face to face communication. Playing it any other way simply means that you don't understand the essence of the game.
Mafia was invented in the 80s. Since then a lot of game variations have appeared and they have spread across the globe.

Traditionally, in order to play this game, <span class="text-red">a group of people need to gather in a single room and remain in that room until the game is over</span>.
Also, conventional way of playing Mafia implies that <span class="text-red">one person in the group is the moderator of the game and, therefore, does not participate in the game</span>.
<br/>
In the beginning of the game, moderator shuffles a deck of cards and gives each of the participants one card. Participant's role in the game is determined based on the card that he/she received from the moderator.
<span class="text-red">It is imperative that none of the participants gets even a glimpse of the card that was intended for another person</span>.
If this pre-requisite is obstructed, then the entire game is pointless.
<br/>
Throughout the game, moderator narrates and leads the participants through the game. Moderator says stuff like: "Night has come. Entire town goes to sleep.". And then, all players should close their eyes.
<span class="text-red">If a player, accidentally or intentionally, peeks during a time when moderator ordered that all eyes must be shut, the entire game is ruined and it is pointless to continue.</span>

<br/>
Moderator is the only person in the room that has complete knowledge about the game. As a moderator narrates for almost the entire duration of the game, it is not uncommon for him/her to make a mistake
and <span class="text-red">discloses an information that was not supposed to be disclosed</span>. In these situations, it is also not uncommon that the entire game gets broken and it becomes pointless to continue.



<h2>Playing online</h2>

There are several online sites where Mafia can be played exclusively over chat rooms or forums. I think that's ridiculous and I don't see the fun in that.
This game is supposed to be about real life interaction, acting, persuading, lobbying, lying and detecting liars, deceiving, gossiping. It should be about tactics and outwitting your opponent.
<br/>
So, how does this site fits in the picture?
<br/>
It simply eliminates the bad things from the traditional gameplay.
<br/>
The key thing to notice is that there is no need for a moderator. The server takes on the entire role of the moderator.
In the previous chapter, some of the downsides of traditional gameplay are painted <span class="text-red">red</span>.

To state the benefits explicitly:
<ul>
    <li><span class="text-green">There is no need for people to be in the same room all the time</span>.
        In fact, the proposed way is to <b>play the game in real-time</b>. As the day and night exchange cyclically in real life, so do they within the game.
        People (participants) meet in their workplace, classroom or neighbourhood as they would any other day. Except, now there are extra news to be shared and discussed:
        <i>Who got killed this morning? Who are you voting for this evening?</i>
    </li>
    <li><span class="text-green">No need for a moderator</span>. This is important because, now, no person knows the entire state of the game. If they don't know it, there is no danger that a classified information will be leaked.
        Also, this means additional player in your group.</li>
    <li><span class="text-green">There are no role cards</span>. This is the key concept in the online game. After the first, initial login into the game, there is no way to prove your authentic game role to anyone. For more info on this, check <i>Advanced</i> section in the bottom of the page.</li>
    <li><span class="text-green">No peeking problems</span>. Player performs all delicate actions when and where he/she wants.</li>
</ul>

In general, this online version of Mafia is created with one thought in mind: <span class="text-green">Nothing classifies as <i>cheating</i></span>.
You are free to say or do anything in order to assure victory for your team.


Notice that this web app only serves as a platform where players are submitting their votes and actions.
Also, it is a place where players can check up on the state of the game (<i>Who is alive and who is dead? What game phase are we in currently? Daytime or night time?</i>).
<br/>
The <b>real</b> gameplay is kept where it belongs. In the real world, in the actual communication between people who meet face to face on a daily basis.
