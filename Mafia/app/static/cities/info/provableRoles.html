<h3>Provable Roles</h3>

One of the main guidelines in creating this game was to make it impossible for a player to prove his true game role to anyone. This is why every player has the option to
adjust his interface so that it appears he has a different game role.
<br/>
<br/>

    This, however, does not immediately resolve all issues regarding proving one's game role.

    <br/>
    For example, a Doctor can obviously always prove his role to a Mafia member. But, this would be illogical since the doctor's team does not benefit from doing that.
        If a doctor would have been able to prove his role to an ordinary Citizen, that would've been a different story.
        <br/>
    Likewise, a player can always prove that he is a Terrorist by performing the bombing attack. However, why would he do that when it is not in any way improving his team's chances of winning.
        <br/>
    Sheriff is the only role that can prove his role within the game. By announcing that the identities of dead players will be revealed the next day and fulfilling
that promise, the sheriff has successfully proven his role. This is why there should always be a very small number of sheriffs in the game (about 1 / 20).

        The question of proving one's game role quickly leads to the question of <b>disproving</b> one's game role.
        Take Terrorist as the best example. Since a Terrorist is always able to prove his role, some players can be requested to perform the bombing attack
in order to <b>prove that they are NOT</b> terrorists. If their actions produce no result, they have successfully <i>cleared their name</i> and are no longer suspected to be the terrorists.

        <br/>
        <br/>
        Terrorist, Sheriff and Necromancer are the only roles that are susceptible to this kind of <i>interrogations</i>. This is because only these roles perform actions that individually
produce results that are visible to everyone.

        <br/>
        The disproving of Sheriff's role is not addressed at all.

        <be/>
        The problem of disproving Terrorist and Necromancer roles are handled in two ways:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Terrorist has <b>detonation delay</b>. Necromancer has the <b>revival delay</b>. This delay gives a player more time and ways to cancel their action before it has been executed.
            </li>
            <li> <b> If either Terrorist or Necromancer have a faked version of <u>Mafia Members</u> list, their Bomb/Revive actions are automatically treated as void and produce no result.</b>
                Once they alter the Mafia Members list so that it includes all of the actual mafia members, they can use their special abilities again.
                What this means is that the only way to prove that you are a Terrorist or a Necromancer is to also incriminate the rest of your team.
            </li>
        </ol>
