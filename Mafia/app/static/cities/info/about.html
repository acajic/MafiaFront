Mafia is an old game that is played live, through personal interaction and face to face communication.
Mafia was invented in the 80s. Since then a lot of game variations have appeared and they have spread across the globe.

With the Internet, the game started to be played online. Online games can be the long ones that last for several days (on forums) or the short ones
that are played out in one continuous session (on chat rooms or specialized sites).

So, where does this site fit in? It is best described visually.

<br/>

Although not immediately obvious, playing short games requires more <i>effort</i> than playing the long ones.
<br/><br/>
When playing a short game, you attention must be exclusively
focused on the game for at least an hour. During that time you are constrained to remain at one location and wait until you are eliminated from the game or the game is over.
<br/>
When playing a long game, the line between you playing a game and living your everyday life is blurred. For only a couple of minutes per day you actually have to <i>do something </i>
you wouldn't normally do. That is, log into the game and submit your vote or action.

This site combines best of both live and online play. The following text explains this in more detail.


<h2>Playing traditionally</h2>


Traditionally, in order to play this game, <span class="text-red">a group of people need to gather in a single room and remain in that room until the game is over</span>.
Also, conventional way of playing Mafia implies that <span class="text-red">one person in the group is the moderator of the game and, therefore, does not participate in the game</span>.
<br/>
In the beginning of the game, moderator shuffles a deck of cards and gives each of the participants one card. Participant's role in the game is determined based on the card that he/she received from the moderator.
<span class="text-red">It is imperative that none of the participants gets even a glimpse of the card that was intended for another person</span>.
If this pre-requisite is obstructed, then the entire game is pointless.
<br/>
Throughout the game, moderator narrates and leads the participants through the game. Moderator says stuff like: "Night has come. Entire town goes to sleep.". And then, all players should close their eyes.
<span class="text-red">If a player, accidentally or intentionally, peeks during a time when moderator ordered that all eyes must be shut, the entire game is ruined and it is pointless to continue.</span>

<br/>
Moderator is the only person in the room that has complete knowledge about the game. As a moderator narrates for almost the entire duration of the game, it is not uncommon for him/her to make a mistake
and <span class="text-red">discloses an information that was not supposed to be disclosed</span>. In these situations, it is also not uncommon that the entire game gets broken and it becomes pointless to continue.



<h2>Playing online</h2>

There are several online sites where Mafia can be played exclusively over chat rooms or forums. I think that's ridiculous and I don't see the fun in that.
This game is supposed to be about real life interaction, acting, persuading, lobbying, lying and detecting liars, deceiving, gossiping. It should be about tactics and outwitting your opponent.
<br/>
So, how does this site fits in the picture?
<br/>
It simply eliminates the bad things from the traditional gameplay.
<br/>
The key thing to notice is that there is no need for a moderator. The server takes on the entire role of the moderator.
In the previous chapter, some of the downsides of traditional gameplay are painted <span class="text-red">red</span>.

To state the benefits explicitly:
<ul>
    <li><span class="text-green">There is no need for people to be in the same room all the time</span>.
        In fact, the proposed way is to <b>play the game in real-time</b>. As the day and night exchange cyclically in real life, so do they within the game.
        People (participants) meet in their workplace, classroom or neighbourhood as they would any other day. Except, now there are extra news to be shared and discussed:
        <i>Who got killed this morning? Who are you voting for this evening?</i>
    </li>
    <li><span class="text-green">No need for a moderator</span>. This is important because, now, no person knows the entire state of the game. If they don't know it, there is no danger that a classified information will be leaked.
        Also, this means additional player in your group.</li>
    <li><span class="text-green">There are no role cards</span>. This is the key concept in the online game. After the first, initial login into the game, there is no way to prove your authentic game role to anyone. For more info on this, check <a ng-click="showStaticPage(3)">Advanced</a> section in the bottom of the page.</li>
    <li><span class="text-green">No peeking problems</span>. Player performs all delicate actions when and where he/she wants.</li>
    <li><span class="text-green">Possibilities of exciting new roles</span> that can only exist within the online gameplay.</li>
</ul>

In general, this online version of Mafia is created with one thought in mind: <span class="text-green">Nothing classifies as <i>cheating</i></span>.
You are free to say or do anything in order to assure victory for your team.


Note that this web app only serves as a platform where players are submitting their votes and actions.
Also, it is a place where players can check up on the state of the game (<i>Who is alive and who is dead? What game phase are we in currently? Daytime or night time?</i>).
<br/>
The <b>real</b> gameplay is kept where it belongs. In the real world, in the actual communication between people who meet face to face on a daily basis.
