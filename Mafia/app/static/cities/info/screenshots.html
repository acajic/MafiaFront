<h3>Screenshots</h3>

People you are playing with requested you to prove your role by sending them a screenshot when you log into the game. <br/>
<br/>

This is not a problem. Every piece of data that is displayed when you log into the game can be altered. Just double click on it. <br/>
<br/>

Be careful, though. Once you alter something, there is no <i>undo</i> option. Why? Because that would be another way of getting to the authentic information.
The authentic information about your true role can be received only on first login to the game. After that point, the only place it cannot be deleted from is your head. Everything can be modified. <br/>
<br/>


Important thing to keep in mind. When you change your role, you haven't actually <i>changed your role</i>.
You merely changed your <b>acting role</b>. That is, you changed the role that you are pretending to be. Up to this point you were also pretending to be a certain game role. The only difference is that you've been pretending to be a role that in fact is your true game role. <br/>
<br/>

When you are voting or doing some other special activities in the game, all you are actually doing is submitting <b>actions</b> to the server. <br/>
When the time comes, the server classifies all actions as <b>valid</b>, <b>void</b> or <b>malformed</b>.

If you are not changing your acting role, that is, if you are playing straight and use the role
you were assigned at the start of the game, all your actions will be <b>valid</b>.
This means your actions will produce <b>valid results</b>.
Valid results are the results that reflect the actual state of the game. <br/>

<br/>

<b>For example</b>, if your true role in the game is <b>Detective</b>. You decide to investigate <i>playerA</i>. On the following morning, in your <i>Special</i> tab, you receive a notification: "PlayerA is not a mafia member." <br/>

Because your investigation action was <b>valid</b>, you can trust the notification you received to be telling the truth. <br/>

<br/>

If, on the other hand, your true role in the game is <b>Citizen</b> and you decide to change your acting role to <b>Detective</b>.
You go to your <i>Special</i> tab and all of the Detective's abilities are at your disposal, just as if that was your true role.
You decide to investigate <i>playerA</i>. On the next morning, you log in and check your <i>Special</i> tab.
There you find a new notification saying "PlayerA is a mafia member.". <br/>

<br/>

Since you submitted the investigation action assuming the role that is not truly yours, the server classified your action as <b>void</b>.
Most commonly, void actions produce results that are random. In other words, you could have easily gotten the notification "PlayerA is <b>not</b> a mafia member.". <br/>
That being said, you cannot trust anything that comes as a result of a void action. <br/>

<br/>

<b>Malformed</b> actions are actions that make no sense. Such actions are impossible to submit without using developer tools for submitting custom HTTP requests.
An example of such request would be a user acting as a <b>Doctor</b> submitting an <b>Investigate</b> action. Malformed actions produce no results whatsoever. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>

When a player dies, they can still submit actions.
All actions that would be classified as <b>valid</b> if the player was alive are now classified as <b>void</b>.
This is to enable roles and features that allow deceiving players into thinking that some players are dead even if they aren't (Necromancer & Zombie).
