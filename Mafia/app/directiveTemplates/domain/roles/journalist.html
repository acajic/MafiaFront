        He has a special ability to <b>investigate</b> a single resident in a single night. <br/>

        As a result, on the next morning, a journalist will be informed that the investigated resident is a
        mafia member only if:
        <ol>
            <li>that resident is, in fact, a mafia member;</li>
            <li>that resident took part in mafia voting on the night he was investigated.</li>
        </ol>
        <br/>
        Both of the stated conditions must be met in order for a journalist to receive an affirmative response.
        Otherwise, a journalist will be informed that the investigated resident is not a mafia member.
