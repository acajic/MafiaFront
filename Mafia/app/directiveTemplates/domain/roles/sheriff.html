        <b>Sheriff</b> plays with citizens. <br/>

        When a sheriff dies, a random ordinary citizen is selected to become the new sheriff. <br/>

        Sheriff has a special ability to <b>reveal</b> exact roles of all residents that died during the time this user was sheriff.
        After this ability is utilized, on the next morning, the true roles of
        certain deceased resident will be revealed to the entire city.
        <br/>

        By default, Sheriff can only use his special ability once in a lifetime.
