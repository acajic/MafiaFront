<b>Necromancer</b> plays on board with <b>the Mafia</b>. <br/>

A Necromancer has the ability to one time in the game raise any dead player back to life. <br/>

Once the Revive action has been submitted, a delay of 5 minues (default) must pass before the action is acknowledged on the server. After the action has been acknowledged, on the following morning the selected player will be revived.
On the morning when the player gets resurrected, a note is posted on the public news feed that a necromancer has revived someone. After that point, obviously, the action can no longer be cancelled.
On the morning of revival, it is still unclear who exactly has been resurrected. In the list of residents, that person will still appear dead, although they are actually alive.



The revived player is given a new Role - Zombie, which is a simple mafia role and has no special abilities.
This means that, once a dead player is resurrected, he/she automatically switches into the Mafia team.

<br/>
<br/>
If a necromancer performs a Revive action while having a fake group of users as mafia members, the action will be deemed void and will not produce any result.
