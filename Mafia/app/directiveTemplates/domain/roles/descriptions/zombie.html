<b>Zombie</b> play with the Mafia. <br/>

Nobody can be assigned this role at the beginning of the game. Instead, a user can <i>become</i> a Zombie after being raised from the dead by a <b>Necromancer</b>.
After a player has become a Zombie, they still cannot see the list of actual mafia members. A revived user cannot even see who is the Necromancer that revived him/her.
It is up to the Necromancer and the other mafia members to reveal as much information they want to a newly acquired member of the team.

<br/>
After a player is resurrected into a Zombie, he/she still appears dead for some time to all other players.

<br/>
Zombie can participate in daytime public voting. <br/>
As any other mafia role, a Zombie can participate in <b>mafia voting</b>.
