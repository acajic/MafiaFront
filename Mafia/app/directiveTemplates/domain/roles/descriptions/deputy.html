<b>Deputy</b> plays with <b>the Citizens</b>. <br/>

Deputy has a special ability to <b>reveal</b> exact roles of all residents that died during the time this user was operating as a deputy.
When this ability is utilized, a Deputy will see the result of this action on the next morning. The true roles of
some deceased residents will be revealed to <b>his eyes only</b>.
