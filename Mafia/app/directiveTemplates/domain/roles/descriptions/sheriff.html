<b>Sheriff</b> plays with <b>the Citizens</b>. <br/>



Sheriff has a special ability to <b>reveal</b> exact roles of all residents that died during the time this user was sheriff.
After this ability is utilized, on the next morning, the true roles of
some deceased residents will be revealed to the entire city.
<br/>

By default, Sheriff can only use his special ability once in a single game. <br/>

When a sheriff dies, a random ordinary <b>Citizen</b> is selected to become the new sheriff.
If there are no more ordinary citizens alive when the sheriff dies, nobody becomes the new sherff. <br/>
