<b>Citizen</b> is a basic role on <b>the Citizens</b> team. <br/>
Citizen's only ability is to vote who is going to be executed at the end of each day. Practically everybody else also has this ability. In this voting, the player that receives the majority of votes get "lynched" (killed).
An example: If there are 10 living players. Player A receives 2 votes, player B receives 1 vote, player C receives 1 vote and the remaining 6 players hadn't even voted, player A will get killed at the end of the day. If the voting results in a tie, nobody gets killed.
