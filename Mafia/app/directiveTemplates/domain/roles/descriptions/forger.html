<b>Forger</b> is the same role as the Elder, only is sided with the Mafia. <br/>

Forger can forge public votes. Therefore Forger can vote multiple times in a single day, but not for the same person.<br/>

<b>All votes targeting distinct residents are accepted</b>. <br/>

<b>A forger can vote variable number of times, but each time for a different resident.</b>
This means that a resident with this role can submit [0..N] valid votes each day, with N being the number of players in the game. <br/>

If a Forger votes for the same resident multiple times in the same day, these duplicates count as a single vote.

<br/>
<br/>

Also, as any other mafia role, Forger can participate in <b>mafia voting</b>. A resident that is selected during mafia voting will be killed during the following night.
