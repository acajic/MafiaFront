        <b>Ambivalent Citizen</b> is a role similar to a basic <b>Citizen</b>. <br/>
        Like the ordinary Citizen, Ambivalent Citizen's only ability is to <b>vote</b> who is going to be executed at the end of each day. <br/>
        The only thing different is that, in case of an ordinary citizen, at the end of the day phase, only the last vote action is taken into consideration.
        In case when ambivalent citizen is casting votes, <b>all votes targeting distinct residents are accepted</b>. <br/>
        <b>Ambivalent residents can vote variable number of times, but each time for a different resident.</b>
        This means that a resident with this role can submit [0..N] votes each day, with N being the number of players in the game.
