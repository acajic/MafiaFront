        Ambivalent Citizen is a role similar to a basic <b>Citizen</b>. <br/>
        Like the ordinary Citizen, Ambivalent Citizen's only ability is to vote who is going to be executed at the end of each day. <br/>
        The only thing different is that in case of an ordinary citizen, only the last Vote the resident submitted is taken into consideration.
        In case when ambivalent citizen is casting votes, all votes targeting distinct residents are accepted.
        Ambivalent residents can vote variable number of times, but each time for a different resident.
        This means that a resident with this role can submit [0..N] votes each day, with N being the number of players in the game.
